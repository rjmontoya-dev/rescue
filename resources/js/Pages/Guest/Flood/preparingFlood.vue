                                <h1 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Prepare to evacuate.</h1>
                                <p class="mb-4">Never ignore an evacuation order— authorities will direct you to leave if you are in a low-lying area or within the greatest potential path of rising waters.
                                    Even if you haven’t been ordered to evacuate yet, it’s always best to be prepared when a flood watch is issued. To prepare your home, car, and loved ones for a potential evacuation:</p>
                                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 " >
                                    <li class="mb-4">Fill your vehicle’s gas tank and make sure the emergency kit for your car is ready.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Identify essential documents such as medical records, insurance card along with ID cards and put in waterproof material to carry with you during evacuation.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Fill your clean water containers.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">If you have pet, identify a shelter designated for pets.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Review your emergency plans and supplies, checking to see if any items are missing.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Tune in the radio or television for weather updates.</li>

                                    <li class="mb-4">Put livestock and family pets in a safe area. Due to food and sanitation requirements, emergency shelters cannot accept animals.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Adjust the thermostat on refrigerators and freezers to the coolest possible temperature.</li>

                                    <li class="mb-4">If you have time, turn off the gas, electricity, and water.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Disconnect appliances to prevent electrical shock when power is restored.</li>
