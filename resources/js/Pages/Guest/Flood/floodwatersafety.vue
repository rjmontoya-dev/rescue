                                <p>It is important to protect yourself from exposure to floodwater regardless of the source of contamination. The best way to protect yourself is to stay out of the water.</p>
                                <p>If you come in contact with floodwater:</p>
                                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4" >
                                    <li class="mb-4">Wash the area with soap and clean water as soon as possible. If you don’t have soap or water, use alcohol-based wipes or sanitizer.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Take care of <a class="url" href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/woundcare.html">wounds</a>  and seek medical attention if necessary.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Wash clothes contaminated with flood or sewage water in hot water and detergent before reusing them.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h1 class="title mt-5 mb-4">Prevent injuries.</h1>
                                <p>Floodwater may contain sharp objects, such as glass or metal fragments, that can cause injury and lead to infection. Prompt first aid can help heal small wounds and prevent infection.
                                If you receive a puncture wound or a wound contaminated with feces, soil, or saliva, have a health care professional determine whether a tetanus booster is necessary based on individual records.</p>

                                <p>Open wounds and rashes exposed to floodwater can become infected. Vibrios, for example, are naturally occurring bacteria that live in certain coastal waters and can cause skin infections when an open wound is exposed to them. This can happen during floods. To protect yourself and your family:</p>
                                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4" >
                                    <li class="mb-4">Avoid exposure to floodwater if you have an open wound.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Cover clean, open wounds with a waterproof bandage to reduce chance of infection.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">Keep open wounds as clean as possible by washing well with soap and clean water.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">If a wound develops redness, swelling, or oozing, seek immediate medical attention.</li>
                                </ul>
                                 <p>Seek medical attention as soon as possible if:</p>
                                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mt-4" >
                                    <li class="mb-4">There is a foreign object (soil, wood, metal, or other objects) embedded in the wound;</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">The wound is at special risk of infection (such as a dog bite or a puncture by a dirty object);</li>
                                    <li class="mb-4">An old wound shows signs of becoming infected (increased pain and soreness, swelling, redness, draining, or you develop a fever).</li>
                                </ul>
